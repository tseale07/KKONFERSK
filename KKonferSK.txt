Welcome to KahLua Konfer, Suicide Kings Edition. KahLua Konfer is part of a
larger suite of addons called "KahLua". There are several versions of the
Konfer module, each which deals with different loot distribution systems.
This one implements the Suicide Kings system.  KonferEPGP implements the EP/GP
loot system, KPUG is a tool for pugs, and Konfer Kouncil is a tool to assist
loot councils.

KSK is fully documented at http://kahluamod.com/ksk.

Hopefully using KonferSK is largely self-explainatory, but here are some
pointers on initial setup, and best practices.

The basic command for accessing KSK is simply /ksk. There are a number of
arguments you can give this command, which are discussed briefly below.

KSK can manage multiple "configuration spaces". Think of a configuration
space (hereafter refered to simply as a config) as a totally unique instance
of the mod. It has its own user lists, roll lists, loot lists, administrators
and event history. Only one configuration can be the "active" one at a time,
although if you do have multiple configurations, you can still receive events
from all configurations. You select the active configuration using the
drop-down at the top right hand corner of the KSK window. Each config has
an owner and a list of co-admins, and a list of users who are known to that
config. A user must be defined in the user list in order to appear in any
roll lists. There are two types of configs: guild and PUG. Guild configs
use the guild addon channel for all their communication, and do certain
security checks based on rank. PUG configs use the current raid addon channel
for all their communication, and are intended for those rare cases where you
may have a regular PUG with users from many guilds and you want to use KSK
for loot distribution.

FIRST TIME USAGE
================

If this is the very first time you are using KSK, you need to create an
initial config. To do this, type "/ksk createconfig NAME", where NAME is the
name of the configuration, and cannot contain the colon (:) character. The
default behaviour is to create a PUG config. If this new config is intended
for guild loot distribution, you should change its type. The person who creates
the config is always the config owner (although that can be changed later).
Once you have created the initial config. type "/ksk" to open the main KSK
window. Type "/ksk config admin" to open the config admin tab, and set the
config type to "Guild" if this is a guild config.

If you are not a guild master (or officer) or raid leader managing loot and
you are using KSK simply to facilitate easy bidding and keep up to date with
the loot lists, you DO NOT NEED TO CREATE A CONFIGURATION! Rather, the guild
master or officers will broadcast the config, and as a normal user, it will
be automatically created for you. As a non-admin your view of the mod will
be considerably less than an admin's view, but you can see all the parts
that are relevant to normal users.

BOTTOM TABS
===========

At the bottom of the window are several tabs. Normal users can see the
first two only, and config admins can see all five. They are, in order:

Lists (/ksk or /ksk lists)
  The default view. Shows the list of roll lists on the left, and the
  list members, in their priority order, on the right for the selected
  list. Config admins will have a number of buttons to the right that can
  be used to move users on the lists. Config admins will also have access to
  a "Config" tab at the top of the screen, which is where you add, delete,
  rename, import and configure roll lists.

Loot (/ksk loot)
  Shows the loot distribution window. It is divided into 5 panes. The top
  left pane is the list of roll lists, the bottom left pane is the list of
  members of that list, in order. The top right pane is the list of loot
  from the current mob or chest, the middle right pane contains the loot
  filter settings (who is allowed to bid or roll on items) and the bottom
  right pane contains the list of current bidders. Normal users can use
  the "Bid" button on the bottom right pane to place a bid, or the "Retract"
  button to retract an existing bid. Config admins have some extra buttons
  for forcing bids or retractions. They can also access the item editor from
  the top menu, which is used to set default loot distribution for specific
  items.

Users (/ksk users)
  Accesses the user editor. This is only for admins. Allows an admin to create,
  rename, delete or edit users. Users can (and should) be marked as Enchanters
  if they are suitably high level enchanters you trust, as they can be assigned
  loot to disenchant when there are no bidders. You can also configure alts.
  The config owner decides whether or not alts and mains are "tethered". If
  they are tethered, then the alts and main all occupy the same priority on
  a roll list, if not tethered it is as if they are completely separate users.

Sync (/ksk sync)
  Used by admins to remain in sync with each other.

Config (/ksk config)
  Used by admins to set loot distribution options, and by the config owner
  to set certain high-level policies such as whether or not alts are tethered.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND PROBLEMS
==============================

o  Multiple admins adding users when other admins are offline can
   cause conflicts. It is possible to end up with the same user in the
   user list multiple times if they were added by different admins when
   the others were offline. If this happens, you will need to carefully
   remove one of the users when all admins are in sync.
