Please see the file KKore/credits.txt for credits relating to KKore. This
file is crediting people who helped me during the development of KonferSK
itself.

First, many thanks to Zhinjio, the re-author of Suicide Kings Geo. I used
no code from that mod, but the idea for suicide kings came from using it
in our guild. KonferSK is simply my implementation of suicide kings, and
hopefully addresses some of the weaknesses found in SKG. I hope KSK also
adds a few features not present in SKG.

Second, a big thanks to the folks in #wowuidev on irc.freenode.net. They
answered many questions and were a great resource. Some were more helpful
than others and more forgiving of a newbie (since this is my first mod) but
most of the people there are very smart and helpful. In no particular
order I would like to thank Cairenn, Shirik, Mikk, Foxlit, alestane,
Iriel and Arrowmaster. A special thanks to Adys who pointed me at the tooltip
scanning code found in KSK-Utility.lua. It was a huge help.

Third, thanks to my fellow guildicans in <Hyperion> who allowed me to use
them as unwitting lab rats.

Special thanks to Tynia (EU Realm: Die Silberne Hand) for the German
translation. Some initial work on it was also done by "Mephir". Many thanks.
Thanks to Florian Dupret (Grimal) for the French translation.
